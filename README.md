This is a **Movie Recommender System** built with Python and Streamlit.  
It suggests similar movies based on a **Content-Based Filtering** approach, leveraging movie metadata like genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works

The system uses a **Content-Based Recommendation** approach:  

1. Movie metadata such as **genres, keywords, cast, and crew** are extracted.  
2. Text data is **processed into numerical vectors** using `CountVectorizer` and stemming.  
3. **Cosine Similarity** is calculated between movies to find the most similar ones.  
4. When a movie is selected, the system fetches **poster images from TMDB** and displays the top 5 recommendations.
